a bunch of convenience functions for plotting IRs in GNU octave. I do this often enough that I finally made something semi-official

look at plotmyIRs for an example of useage for comparing multiple files

plotIREQ makes a plot of the magnitude of the frequency response
plotIRwaterfall makes a plot of the time behavior in the lower region (you can easily make it show any region)
fftdecinamte - mostly used internally, approximately downsamples per decade so that you can make cleaner plots on a semilog scale
